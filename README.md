# Pinzy

Welcome to Pinzy. This is a web GIS social media. This version has minimal featues included to make it CRUD.

## Features

- Generic user authentication and registration handled by PHP.
-

This is not a production ready to tackle huge user interaction but a demo webapp for the future Pinzy release to solidify my knowledge on MVC, OOP with vanilla JS, Php and MySql.

# SVGS

- Used fontAwesome locally due to cors-origin-policy issue by fa scripts.

# Noticeabel Drawbacks

- This application uses Leaflet which, in worst cases like slow internet, is noticed to have extremely slow peroformance. The initial load of the map takes too long.
- openstreet map server may be down sometimes or your request may take too long to respond.
- Using it one browser sometimes won't load the map for some reason idk yet.Especially sometimes having trouble loading the map and pins on Microsoft Edge.
